# Journal Entry

Capture anything that would help us work better together in the future.

**Topic/prompt:** $ARGUMENTS

## What to Capture

Think broadly about what would inform and improve future work:

- **Mistakes made** - what went wrong, why, how to avoid next time
- **Things that worked well** - patterns worth repeating
- **Working style observations** - what's important to Seth, preferences, communication patterns
- **Technical learnings** - insights about tools, architecture, approaches
- **Decisions and rationale** - why we chose X over Y
- **Questions raised** - things we didn't resolve but should revisit
- **Process improvements** - how we could work more effectively

## Instructions

### If no topic provided

Review the conversation and suggest 2-4 things worth capturing. Ask Seth which (if any) to journal, or if he wants to capture something else.

### If topic provided

Write an entry on that topic.

### Entry Format

```markdown
# [Descriptive Title]

**Date:** [today's date]
**Context:** [what we were working on]

## Session Summary
[What happened, what was accomplished]

## Key Findings/Decisions
[The substance - what did we learn or decide]

## Working Style Observations
[Patterns noticed about collaboration, preferences - what helps us work better]

## Mistakes & Corrections
[What went wrong, how it was fixed - learning opportunities]

## Documents Created/Updated
[What artifacts were produced - table format if multiple]

## Open Threads
[What's unfinished, what comes next]

## For Next Claude
[Context and orientation for the next session - key files to read, user preferences reinforced, likely next steps]
```

**Note:** Not every section needed every time. Use what's relevant. A quick insight might just be Summary + one other section.

### Process

1. Write the entry (normal file write - Seth can approve/reject/modify like any edit)
2. Save to configured location (see CLAUDE.local.md for $JOURNAL_PATH, or default to docs/journal/)

### First-Time Setup

If no journal exists yet, create the journal directory and write an initial entry that captures:
- What this journal is for
- What kinds of things we want to capture
- Any initial observations from the conversation so far
